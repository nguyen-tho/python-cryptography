# python-cryptography

This is a simple app to demonstrate some cryptographic and hash algorithms made by tkinter and python such as:
  - Cipher Algorithms
    - Caesar Cipher
    - DES (Data encryption standard)
    - AES (Advanced encryption standard)
    - RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman algorithm)
  - Hash functions
    - SHA (256, 512, 1, 224, 3_256)
    - MD5

How to use:
  - Step 1: clone this repository [https://github.com/nguyen-tho/python-cryptography.git]
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/nguyen-tho/python-cryptography.git
    ```
  - Step 2: install dependencies
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    ```
  - Step 3: use it
    ```sh
    # nove to cipher folder
    cd cipher
    # run UI.py file
    python UI.py
    ```
